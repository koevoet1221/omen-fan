# omen-fan
- A simple utility to manually control the fans of a HP Omen laptop
- Works on various HP Omen laptop and even some Victus laptops from testing. 
- Also has a service that actively adjusts the fan speed according to tempertatures (cause the default BIOS control sucks)
- Supports enabling boost mode via sysfs
- Made and tested on an Omen 16-c0140AX
- Rust made and tested on Omen 16-n0xxx series and Omen 15-dc10xxxx

# WARNING
- Forcing this program to run on incompatible laptops may cause hardware damage. Use at your own risk.
- Max speed of the fans are configured based on the "Boost" state. Increasing them is not recommended and won't provide huge thermal beinifits.
